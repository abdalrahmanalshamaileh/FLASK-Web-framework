# Flask Authentication Project

This is a simple Flask web application that implements user authentication using Flask-Login and SQLAlchemy. The application includes user registration, login, logout functionality, and access to a secret page for authenticated users. It also provides the ability to download a file after logging in.

## Features
- User registration with hashed passwords (using `werkzeug.security`).
- User login and session management (using `Flask-Login`).
- Secure password storage with hashing.
- A secret page accessible only to logged-in users.
- File download functionality for logged-in users.

## Project Structure

### Main Application Files

- `app.py`: The main Flask application file that contains the routing and logic for user authentication, registration, login, and file download.
- `users.db`: SQLite database file where the user information is stored. This file is automatically generated when the application is run.

### Directories

#### `instance`
This folder is automatically created by Flask and used to store instance-specific configuration and files, such as:
- **Database**: In this case, `users.db` is stored here when the app runs.

#### `static`
This directory contains static files like images, CSS, and downloadable files. In this project, it includes:
- **`/static/files/cheat_sheet.pdf`**: The downloadable file that authenticated users can access.

#### `templates`
This directory contains the HTML templates for rendering the pages:
- **`index.html`**: The homepage of the application. If a user is logged in, it shows a welcome message.
- **`register.html`**: The registration page where new users can sign up.
- **`login.html`**: The login page where existing users can log in.
- **`secrets.html`**: The secret page that can only be accessed by logged-in users.
